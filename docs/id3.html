<h3><font color="#ff0000">Feedback Needed</font></h3>



Currently I would like to get feedback on the interface, classes, methods provided by the ID3-library.
<p>
Please send me <a href="mailto:tools-NOSPAM@unixgods.org">email</a> and let me know what you think..<br>

<h3>Introduction</h3>






The aim of this ID3 library for Ruby is to do a full <b>native Ruby
implementation </b>of ID3 version 1.x and version 2.x , without any use of
binary libraries, which other implementations need to have installed
separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. other implementations just act as a
wrapper around a binary library - I beleive that this is not as
portable as a Ruby library should be.<br>





Another aim of this implementation is to provide the user with a
uniform API, which tries to hide the details of the different ID3 standards,
therefore making it (hopefully) easier to use.<br>

&nbsp;<br>


<h3>Supported Versions</h3>


ID3 v1.0 , v1.1 , v2.2.x , v2.3.x and v2.4.x<br>


<br>





<h3>ID3 Library Overview</h3>





The library provides  the <a href="Module_ID3.html">Module ID3</a> , which provides some module methods, as well as three simple classes to the user:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="Class_AudioFile.html">AudioFile</a>, <a href="Class_Tag1.html">Tag1</a> and <a href="Class_Tag2.html">Tag2</a>, to handle files which contain ID3-tags.<br>



<br>



The ID3-standards are overloaded with specially coded frames, which are different for each of the binary frames<font color="#ff0000"><sup>1</sup></font>.This
library does not attempt to fully decode each and every frame type, but
rather deals with the main frame types, such as text and web-frames,
and in case of the binary frames hands the contents of the frames to
the user verbatim.&nbsp; If the user chooses to modify or write any of
those binary frames, the user is expected to know what s/he is doing,
and how to code/de-code the binary contents, otherwise expect:&nbsp;
"garbage in --&gt; crash!"&nbsp; of the application which tries to make
sense of such frames later..&nbsp; However, if an ID3-tag contains
binary frames, the user can expect that those are handed verbatim to
the user and that it is safe to write them back 'as is' to a
new/modified ID3-tag of the same audio file. In some cases the user may
choose to delete some of the binary frames, that should be possible
without problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<h3>Known Problems</h3>


Some ID3v2 frames may appear more than once in an ID3-tag!&nbsp; e.g.
TXXX and WXXX. I haven't come across any actual examples for this,
therefore didn't see the necessity to implement this.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Currently there is no support for this.&nbsp; If you come across such
cases, please let me know.. <br>

Documentation</h3>

The main id3.rb documentation is here.<br>


<br>


I complied a comparison between the different <a href="http://www.unixgods.org/%7Etilo/ID3/docs/ID3_comparison.html">ID3-versions</a>, I hope it's helpful.<br>


<br>


<h3>Disclaimer / Author's Rant</h3>


Please feel free to send me "constructive feedback"&nbsp;
anytime.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're missing functionality, or you think
something should be done different, please let me know! I'm always open
for suggestions. Thank you!<br>


<br>


IMHO the ID3 version2.x standards are pretty pretty messy... they are
bloated and&nbsp; overloaded with useless frame-types and
side-effects...&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst is ID3 v2.4.0!&nbsp; I haven't
seen any actual v2.4.x tags yet, if you have examples, please send them
to me. I suspect that the reason why I didn't find any v2.4.x tags
anywhere is because the "2.4.x standard" is just too complicated, so
nobody is using it..&nbsp; proove me wrong and email examples to me ;-)<br>


<br>


Last not least: Please don't complain about the "quality" of the
ID3-standard to me.. I'm certainly most sympathetic with your pain, but
not the right person to complain to.. ;-)<br>
